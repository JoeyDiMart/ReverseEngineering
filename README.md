# ReverseEngineering
Zandronum+C file reverse engineering with Radare2

# part 1
- First part of this CTF is all of the c programs, compile them all with the start.sh bash script
- after, you can use radare2 to reverse engineer the programs and see what they do

# part 2
- I set up a Zandronum DOOM server
- lets reverse engineer the game file, our goal is to get god mode in a controlled private doom server, only root members can join and the game file will not be used to cheat in any way.
